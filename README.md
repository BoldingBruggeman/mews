## Preliminar description of workflow

We will use this repository for all 3 different setups and will keep the key files here. We will try to use a bit advanced workflow utilising forking and pull requests.
Below are the steps required - after the initial cloning it is important to keep the main repository up to date via pull request and also keep up to date in your own work area with regular git pulls.

  1. Fork the *mews* repository
  2. Work in your private repository
  3. When ready - create a *pull request - PR*

Be sure to do a *git pull* on a regular basis to keep up with other contributions.
