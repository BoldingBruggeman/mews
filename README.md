## Preliminar description of workflow

We will use this repository for all 3 different setups and will keep the key files here. We will try to use a bit advanced workflow utilising forking and pull requests.
Below are the steps required - after the initial cloning it is important to keep the main repository up to date via pull request and also keep up to date in your own work area with regular git pulls.

  1. Fork the *mews* repository
  2. Work in your private repository
  3. When ready - create a *pull request - PR*

Be sure to do a *git pull* on a regular basis to keep up with other contributions.



## On the proper naming of data describing the depth of lakes

From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathymetry:

Bathymetry (/bəˈθɪmətri/; from Ancient Greek βαθύς (bathús) 'deep', and μέτρον (métron) 'measure')[1][2] is the study of underwater depth of ocean floors (seabed topography), lake floors, or river floors. In other words, bathymetry is the underwater equivalent to hypsometry or topography. The first recorded evidence of water depth measurements are from Ancient Egypt over 3000 years ago.
