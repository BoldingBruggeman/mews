As suggested in the README file, the best workflow is to create a fork, work in there, and when everything is ready, create a PR
to get everything back on the central (BoldingBruggeman) repository. 

The best way of working inside a fork and simultaneously updating from the central repo, is by setting up a remote.

On your PC, once:
1) git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/mews.git
2) git remote add upstream https://github.com/BoldingBruggeman/mews.git

On your PC, iteratively, in order to get the latest updates from the central repository on your fork:
3) git fetch upstream
4) git merge upstream/main
5) git push
